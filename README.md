Not working? Look [üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting](#%EF%B8%8F-troubleshooting)

> If you don't want to wait for game resources to download, copy the .obb file from: <br>
> Android/obb/com.Mediatonic.FallGuys_client/ to <br>
> Android/obb/com.Mediatonic.FallGuys_client.modmenu/, then rename it by adding .modmenu before .obb <br>
> Final file name example: main.XXXX.com.mediatonic.FallGuys_client.modmenu.obb <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
> This project is created only for educational and entertainment purposes. I won't be providing support.

In The Main Menu it will ask for permission to display over other apps, If it doesn‚Äôt ask for it, grant it manually. <br><br>
**HyperOS, ColorOS, OneUI, HarmonyOS**, and other OEM ROMs may not work properly or at all. <br>
**It is recommended to use ROMs with minimal changes to ART (mainly AOSP forks).** <br>
**EMULATORS ARE NOT SUPPORTED!!** <br> <br>
Also frida and frida-il2cpp-bridge can be unstable. 

## üèóÔ∏è Build
**‚Äî Install dependencies**
1. Make sure you have Python Installed.

pip install frida-tools==13.6.1

4. Install [frida-gadget injector](https://github.com/commonuserlol/fgi) (I'm using that, but you can use any other to inject gadget)
5. Extract .so files and copy downloaded frida gadgets to C:\Users\YOURUSER\\.fgi\arm.so and C:\Users\YOURUSER\\.fgi\arm64.so (rename it to arm.so and arm64.so as well)

2. Use frida-server (if you have root) or run this command to inject frida-gadget in your apk in listen mode:

fgi -i <yourfallguys.apk> --offline-mode
```
3. Install and launch the apk, then inject the script (this command works only if you have frida-gadget, use other if you use frida-server):
```
npm run spawn
```
